# From Join-Request
dev_eui     # From device, uplink, used for identification
app_eui     # From device, uplink, used for matching application
dev_nonce   # From device, uplink, must be unique per session

# Generated by server
app_nonce   # Generated by server, used to derive keys, sent in Join-Accept
net_id      # Static server identity (LoRaWAN operator code)
dev_addr    # Server-generated address assigned to the device

# Secrets
app_key     # Stored only server and the end_device (never shared), needed to derive session keys

# Derived
nwk_skey    # From derive_session_keys(), used for MIC + MAC
app_skey    # From derive_session_keys(), used for application data encryption

# Optional / helper
mac_cmd_dict # Parsed MAC command data from uplink — may lead to YAML updates
NewSKey     # Just alias for nwk_skey — internal to your helper logic
AppSKey     # Same as above
