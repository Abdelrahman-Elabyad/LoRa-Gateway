# When receiving a confirmed data message, the receiver SHALL respond with a data frame
# that has the acknowledgment bit (ACK) set. If the sender is an end-device, the network will
# send the acknowledgement using one of the receive windows opened by the end-device after
# the send operation. If the sender is a gateway, the end-device transmits an acknowledgment
# at its own discretion.
# Acknowledgements are only sent in response to the latest message received and are never
# retransmitted.

# Note: To allow the end-devices to be as simple as possible and have as
# few states as possible it may transmit an explicit (possibly empty)
# acknowledgement data message immediately after the reception of a
# data message requiring a confirmation. Alternatively the end-device may
# defer the transmission of an acknowledgement to piggyback it with its
# next data message.
